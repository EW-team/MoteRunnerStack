  \frametitle{Final considerations about Mote Runner}
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Pro:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Good simulation environment
      \item It allows to develop mote applications in high-level object-oriented languages
      \item Good assumptions and expectations with respect to LoRa
    \end{itemize}
    \item Con:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item It's still in beta
      \item Low support (docs, API, \dots)
      \item Not open source (till now)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Mac status}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Only three states are supported, there are others (orphan,..)
    \item Superframe parameters can't be dinamically changed
    \item In the associated state motes are not energy aware
    \item Some funtionality have not been implemented (e.g. disassociation, channels scan,...)
    \item Transmission from PAN-C to devices seems to require EUI64, but SADDRs are more suited
  \end{itemize}
